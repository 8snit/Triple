            // Suppose we removed the ambient scope instance here. If someone
            // was to start a parallel task without suppressing
            // the ambient context and then tried to suppress the ambient
            // context within the parallel task while the raw flow
            // of execution was still ongoing (a strange thing to do, I know,
            // but I'm sure this is going to happen), we would end up 
            // removing the ambient context instance of the raw flow 
            // of execution from within the parallel flow of execution!
            // 
            // As a result, any code in the raw flow of execution
            // that would attempt to access the ambient scope would end up 
            // with a null value since we removed the instance.
            //
            // It would be a fairly nasty bug to track down. So don't let
            // that happen. Hiding the ambient scope (i.e. clearing the CallContext
            // in our execution flow but leaving the ambient scope instance untouched)
            // is safe.
